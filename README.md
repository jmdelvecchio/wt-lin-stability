Codes supporting analyses in "Thermal channelization of suprapermafrost flows," by K. Warburton, J. Del Vecchio, C. Meyer, and M. Palucis, for submission to <i>Geophysical Research Letters</i>.

# Jupyter notebooks
- `warburton_grl_stability.ipynb` calculates wavelength and growth rate
- `warburton_grl_thermal_data.ipynb` computes thermal properties from field data
- `profiles/imagery-dem-profiler.ipynb` generates an interactive map that overlays imagery and contour lines for drawing topographic profiles of permafrost hillslopes with water tracks. 

# Other
Data in the `upper_kuparuk_data` directory are pulled from the [Arctic Data Center](https://arcticdata.io/catalog/) (search term "Godsey" will pull up all relevant data).
